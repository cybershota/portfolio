      I am a freelance web developer and video editor. I learned basic programming knowledge at
      Alpha Camp, an online session-based course while I worked. In June 2020, I joined Lidemy
      Mentor Program to learn more about web development. I consider myself a creative programmer. I
      love to build up projects for real impact. My video production background improves my vision
      of software development. To me, programming just like writing a novel. Users read the story
      through UI and interaction, and we must tell a good story.
